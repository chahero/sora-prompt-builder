# Sora2 Script Builder üé¨

## About This Project

**Sora2 Script Builder** is a web application designed to help you easily create detailed JSON scripts (prompts) for AI video generation models like OpenAI's Sora. Users no longer need to write complex JSON structures by hand; instead, they can use an intuitive UI to transform their ideas into well-organized video scripts.

This app supports a workflow where users leverage their own LLMs (like ChatGPT or Gemini) to generate an initial script draft, which can then be imported into the app for detailed editing and management.
